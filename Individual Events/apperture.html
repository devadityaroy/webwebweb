        <p>
            If your camera lens has a story to share, this is the best place for it to air. With the stage all set and the countdown pacing down the order its about time Aperture, INNOVACION make its move. With the motive all clear, the 2022 edition of APERTURE, INNOVACION sure looks to surpass its previous records with its extensive outreach and format up-gradations. As INNOVACION again makes its way back into the town with it 2022 edition and sets the IEM and UEM campus with activity, each and every individual from the institute have found their interests and involved themselves in the biggest techno-management event of the city in some way or the other. It is always a feast for every anxious photographer to capture those short-lived moments and take a share out of the ever-flowing river of time.        </p>
